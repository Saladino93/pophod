## Scripts descriptions


### Populating Websky halos for DES Y3 Maglim galaxies

‘python populate_desy3.py -b -model zack‘

where ‘-b‘ makes sure the number density of objects on the full sky is the same as the one in the DES Y3 footprint.


**Make sure you have enough RAM memory!!** A range between 64 GB and 128 GB should be fine.
